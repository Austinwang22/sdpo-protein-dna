# Fine-Tuning Discrete Diffusion Models via Reward Optimization with Applications to DNA and Protein Design

The repository contains the code for the `DRAKES` method presented in the paper: *[Fine-Tuning Discrete Diffusion Models via Reward Optimization with Applications to DNA and Protein design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13643)(2024)*.
`DRAKES` is a fine-tuning method for reward optimization or alignment in discrete diffusion models, utilizing direct backpropagation with the softmax-gumbel trick.

## Regulatory DNA Sequence Design

Our goal here is to optimize the activity of regulatory DNA sequences such that they drive gene expression in specific cell types, a critical task for cell and gene therapy. The detailed code and instructions are in `drakes_dna/`. 

## Protein Sequence Design: Optimizing Stability in Inverse Folding Model

Given a pretrained inverse folding model that generates sequences conditioned on the
backboneâ€™s conformation (3D structure), our goal is to optimize the stability of these generated sequences.  The illustrative figure is as follows. The code and instructions are in `drakes_protein/`.
